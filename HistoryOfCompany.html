  <p>Detective Comics, as we know it today, was not always called Detective Comics.
    It started out in 1935 by the name of 'New Fun: The Big Comic Magazine.' The titles
    continuously evolved from 'New Comics', 'Adventure Comics', and then finally 'Detective Comics'.

    DC, as the company started to refer to itself as, then started to create new and interesting
    characters to gain a readership. Creating characters such as Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman, DC
    started to gain a readership over time and, through the creation of Superman, defined what a superhero
    was supposed to look and behave like.

    Over time, more and more heroes were added to the DC pantheon. Heroes such as Green Lantern, The Flash,
    Martian Manhunter and more!
