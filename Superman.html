      <h1 class="myh1">Welcome to Krypton!!!</h1>
      <p>
        Superman is the sole survivor of the planet Krypton. His father, Jor-El, discovered
         that a nuclear chain reaction was building inside Krypton that would soon shatter the
         entire world. Jor-El therefore had his unborn son Kal-El removed from the Kryptonian
         Gestation Chambers and affixed the life matrix containing Kal-El to an experimental
         vessel for travel through hyperspace. Jor-El launched the starcraft toward Earth just
         before Krypton exploded.

      <h1 class="fort">Strength</h1>
      <p>Superman possesses the powers of flight, superhuman strength, x-ray vision, heat vision,
        cold breath, super-speed, enhanced hearing, and nigh-invulnerability. While Superman is immensely
        strong both in terms of muscle power and ability to take physical punishment, he is not all-powerful.
